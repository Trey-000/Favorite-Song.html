        <h1>Clocks by Coldplay</h1>
        <p>
            And singles such as “Clocks” helped drive the band’s total album sales over the 20 million mark. Coldplay,
            British rock group whose melodic piano-driven anthems
            lifted the band to the top of the pop music world in the early 21st century. Coldplay was formed in 1998 at
            University College, London, with the pairing of pianist-vocalist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland.
            The band was later filled out with fellow students Guy Berryman on bass and Will Champion, a guitarist who
            later switched to drums.

                <li>And a trouble that can't be named</li>
                <li>A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'</li>
